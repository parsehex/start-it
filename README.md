# Start It

An app to manage a list of project starters and templates.

I really like **starters** -- already-made bases to start new projects from. For me, they help with the common problem of "**Where do I start?**" that I see a lot.

I've had a lot of app ideas and I have a large unfinished project graveyard, so I've tried to refine and improve my process for **starting a project** in a fast manner. Fail fast, right?

When I get an idea for something I want to make, this is generally how I try to approach things:

1. Figure out what it is that you want to make.
   1. What are your goals?
   2. What features do you want to have?
   3. Will this be a website? Do you need to have a user system?
2. Do you have any preferences about your tech stack?
